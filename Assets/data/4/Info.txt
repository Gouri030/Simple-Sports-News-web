Late goals and surprises: Is ISL 2024 the season for the underdogs?

The 2024-2025 Indian Super League has kicked off with thrilling last-minute goals, unpredictable match outcomes, and rising competitiveness. New teams like Punjab FC and NorthEast United have shaken up the league, making this season one of the most exciting yet.

In Short
Indian Super League saw 13 goals after the 85th minute
Punjab FC's dramatic late win shocked Kerala Blasters' fans
NorthEast United continues fiery form despite last-minute Mohun Bagan defeat
The 2024-2025 Indian Super League (ISL) season has kicked off with excitement, unpredictability, and a series of last-minute thrillers. New teams, fresh talent, and rising competitiveness have added new dimensions to Indian football’s premier club competition. The league has quickly established itself as one of the most exhilarating ISL campaigns in recent years, keeping fans on the edge of their seats from the first whistle to the final minutes of the games.

NorthEast United's recent success in claiming their first piece of silverware seems to have ignited a heightened level of competitiveness in the ISL. In previous seasons, the "favorites" tag often shifted between big-spending clubs like Mohun Bagan Super Giants, Mumbai City FC, and Bengaluru FC. But this season, even the mid-table and newly-promoted teams have been causing major upsets, challenging the notion of a clear favorite.

One such team, Odisha FC, underwent a major overhaul last year under the management of Sergio Lobera and rose to prominence. But unpredictability has been the key theme of this season. Punjab FC, a team promoted to the ISL just last year, has made an early statement by defeating Odisha FC and Kerala Blasters—two top-tier teams in Indian football. This unpredictability adds to the excitement, ensuring that fans are treated to thrilling contests in every match.

One of the defining features of the ISL 2024-2025 season has been the high number of late goals. Out of the 38 goals scored in the first 12 matches, 13 came after the 85th minute. Teams have been tested to the very end, with last-minute goals becoming a common occurrence.

The most dramatic example was the Punjab FC vs. Kerala Blasters clash, where all three goals were scored after the 85th minute. Luka Majcen gave Punjab the lead in the 86th minute, but Kerala’s Jesus Jimenez equalised in the 92nd minute. However, Filip Mrzljak stunned the crowd by scoring the winner for Punjab just 3 minutes later.s

No team is small anymore
Teams like Mohammedan SC, Punjab FC, and NorthEast United may not have been top contenders in previous seasons, but they’ve quickly emerged as serious threats. These teams may lack the big names, but they’re creating new stars through their impressive performances. Mohammedan SC secured a draw against heavyweights FC Goa, while NorthEast United continued their fiery form from the Durand Cup, though they narrowly lost to Mohun Bagan in a dramatic last-minute 3-2 defeat.

Though the season is still in its early stages, the ISL 2024-2025 promises to be a fiercely competitive and unpredictable affair. The quality of football has risen, and fans can expect plenty more drama in the matches to come.
